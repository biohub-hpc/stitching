"""Per-FOV chunk tile source for the shard_to_hcs converted store.

Drop-in replacement for ``RawShardTileSource`` when the raw acquire-zarr shards
have already been converted to a per-FOV HCS zarr on local scratch. Estimate
reads from ``/tmp/livescreen_JOBID/livescreen_converted.zarr`` instead of
``/hpc/instruments/.../*.ome.zarr``.

Why: raw shards are 640 MB blosc-encoded blocks on NFS. To fetch one FOV you
touch the whole shard (256 FOVs × 4 cams). With a per-FOV converted store on
local xfs, each fetch is a single 5-MB chunk file at 2 GB/s local disk. Cuts
estimate's read wall by ~5-8x.

Interface matches ``RawShardTileSource``:
    src = ConvertedTileSource(store_root, channel=0, flipud=..., ...)
    tile = src["003005"]      # -> numpy uint16 (frame_y, frame_x)

Layout expected (from ``ops_analysis.livescreen.stitch.shard_to_hcs``):
    <store_root>/A/1/<RRRCCC>/0/zarr.json
    <store_root>/A/1/<RRRCCC>/0/c/0/<C>/0/0/0    (blosc-encoded chunk file)
